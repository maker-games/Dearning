Dearning is an AI framework library designed to be lightweight and compatible with various devices.
This library was created on January 4, 2025, by Oriza.
Dearning is a pure Python library and uses complex mathematics to optimize its performance.

Previously, Dearning was made on the Redmi 13 my phone and was just a simple tool for AI model experiments.
until Oriza (that's me) learned the Pythagorean theorem formula and researched the mathematical formulas to see if they were good for my project.

Dearning has 7 modules, namely:

- Quantum :
- service :
- training :
- utils :
