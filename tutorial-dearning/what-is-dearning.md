## About Dearning
Dearning is an AI framework library designed to be lightweight and compatible with various devices.  
This library was created on **January 4, 2025**, by **Oriza** but the release on pypi is on **August 25, 2025**.  
Dearning is a **pure Python library** and uses complex mathematics to optimize its performance.

Previously, Dearning was made on my **Redmi 13** phone and was just a simple tool for AI model experiments —  
until Oriza (that’s me) learned the **Pythagorean theorem** and started researching mathematical formulas  
to see if they could improve my project.

For those who asked why it took so long to release, it was because at that time I didn't have a laptop to upload and develop these libraries.
